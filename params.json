It is possible to start iPython in other ways (e.g. in the terminal window, without inline plots, or using the Qt console), but this is the way the course examples/exercises were intended to be run.\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\n### Presentation\r\n\r\nThe presentation is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license: \r\n\r\n* [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\r\n\r\nsummarised below\r\n\r\n    You are free to:\r\n\r\n    Share — copy and redistribute the material in any \r\n            medium or format\r\n    Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the \r\n            material for any purpose, even commercially.\r\n    \r\n    The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long \r\n    as you follow the license terms.\r\n    \r\n    Under the following terms:\r\n\r\n    Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, \r\n                 provide a link to the license, and \r\n                 indicate if changes were made.
