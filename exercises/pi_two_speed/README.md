# README.md - Phytophthora

## Overview

This directory contains an example iPython notebook which uses supplementary data from the [Haas *et al.* (2009)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08358) *P. infestans* genome paper to emulate elements of Figure 2 from that publication, showing evidence for genome expansion and its association with pathogen effectors.

## Running the notebook

At the command line, issue

```
ipython notebook
```

and click on the filename `pi_two_speed.ipynb`, to start the notebook.

(Example output can be viewed at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/widdowquinn/Teaching-EMBL-Plant-Path-Genomics/blob/master/data/Phytophthora/pi_two_speed.ipynb))
