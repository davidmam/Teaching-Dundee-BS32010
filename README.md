# README.md - BS32010 University of Dundee

## Overview

This repository contains teaching materials used in delivering the BS32010 bioinformatics course lecture and workshops on "Comparative Genome Analysis and Visualisation" at the University of Dundee, March 2016

The format has changed since 2015, and now takes the form of:

* One introductory lecture (1hr)
* Two workshops (2hr each)

The lecture notes and slides can be found in the `lecture` subdirectory, and the material for the workshops can be found in `workshop_1` and `workshop_2`.



## Getting Started

You can grab a local copy of all the files for this workshop/lecture using `git clone`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/widdowquinn/Teaching-Dundee-BS32010
```

### Prerequisites

The exercises and examples have been written, and are known to run, with the following software, but they may also run happily on other versions:

* `Python` 3.5.1
* `Jupyter` 4.06
* `Biopython` 1.66
* `Pandas` 0.17.1
* `i-ADHoRe` 3.0.01

* `MUMmer` 3.23
* `MCL` 14-137

## Executing notebooks

To start the notebooks in your browser, execute

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

at the command-line. 

You will be able to read the HTML sessions in your browser, but the work for these will be done largely in the terminal or standalone applications.
