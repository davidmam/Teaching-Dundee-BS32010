# README.md - Teaching-2015-03-17-UoD_compgenvis

## Overview

This repository contains teaching materials used in delivering the first part of the 3rd year bioinformatics course lectures on "Comparative Genome Analysis and Visualisation" at the University of Dundee, 2015

## Getting Started

You can grab a local copy of all the files for this workshop/lecture using `git clone`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/widdowquinn/Teaching-2015-03-17-UoD_compgenvis.git
```

The lecture is presented in a tutorial/workshop format, with interactive examples and exercises using [iPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 

* Slides for the talk are provided in the `presentation` subdirectory, in LaTeX format for use with [Beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_%28LaTeX%29).
* Example exercises and data are found in the `data` subdirectory.

### Prerequisites

The exercises and examples have been written, and are known to run, with the following software, but they may also run happily on other versions:

* **Python 2.7**
* **iPython (with pylab and matplotlib) 1.1.0**
* **Biopython 1.63+**
* **Pandas 0.13**

## Executing iPython notebooks

To start iPython in a suitable form in your browser, execute

```
$ ipython notebook
```

at the command-line. It is possible to start iPython in other ways (e.g. in the terminal window, without inline plots, or using the Qt console), but this is the way the course examples/exercises were intended to be run.
